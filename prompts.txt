a liminal office hallway with glowing green lights and no people
a surreal city bus stop at night under purple skies
an abandoned school gym with flickering fluorescent lights
a lonely train station bathed in fog and neon lights
a dreamlike corridor with endless mirrors and blue glow
a waiting room frozen in time, red carpet and old TVs
a post-apocalyptic playground in golden hour light
a stairwell that leads to nothing, liminal architecture
a corridor inside a shopping mall with surreal symmetry
a forgotten laundromat in a parallel reality
