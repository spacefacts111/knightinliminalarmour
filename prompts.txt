a liminal hallway with flickering lights and blue carpet
a forgotten underground mall with ghostly reflections
a dreamlike stairwell lit by green neon
an empty room filled with fog and static TVs
a night drive through a surreal tunnel
a lonely bus stop lit by a red glow
a vending machine in a void space
an abandoned school lit by dying sunlight
a gas station in the middle of nowhere
a hotel hallway that never ends
